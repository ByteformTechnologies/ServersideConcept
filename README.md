## ServersideConcept

> [!WARNING]
> This is a **serverside executor** concept for Roblox, designed to facilitate executing serverside scripts in your own game. 

### Overview
- **Purpose**: The script acts as a serverside executor, enabling the execution of serverside scripts within your Roblox game.
- **Scope**: This serverside executor is intended for use only within your own games and does not inject or impact serverside logic in other games.
- **Self-contained**: It operates independently, maintaining its integrity and ensuring no external influence from other game servers.

### Features
- **Server-State Execution**: Executes critical serverside scripts, handling game logic, player data, and other server-critical components efficiently.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt and configure the script to fit your specific game needs.
- **Secure**: Helps maintain the integrity and stability of serverside operations.
- **Require Execution**: Enables execution of `require` scripts to load necessary game modules and libraries.

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Import the `.rbxm` file into your Roblox game.
3. Put the `.rbxm` to `StarterGui` to ensure proper execution.
4. Apply the script according to your gameâ€™s requirements.
5. Adjust and extend the script to suit your specific use case.

### Important Notes
- **Heads up**: This is a serverside executor and only works in your own games, not in other games.
- **Exclusive Use**: This script is intended for use in your own Roblox games only and does not inject or influence other game servers.
- **Security**: Ensure to follow best practices to maintain server security and stability.
- **GUI**: The executor will be inside the StarterGUI meaning that everyone can use it. I would suggest coding so that only you may be able to see this GUI.
